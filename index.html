            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">We collect, process, analyze, and utilize various categories of information including but not limited to personal data (such as names, email addresses, phone numbers, postal addresses, demographic information, and identification numbers), non-personal data (including device identifiers, IP addresses, browser fingerprints, and system configurations), technical data (encompassing log files, cookies, pixels, beacons, and similar tracking technologies), behavioral data (comprising usage patterns, click-through rates, session durations, page views, and interaction metrics), and inferred data (derived through algorithmic analysis, predictive modeling, and machine learning processes applied to your activity patterns and preferences). In addition, we may collect information about your device's operating system, browser type, language preferences, and geographic location to further personalize your experience. We may also gather data from publicly available sources, business partners, and third-party vendors to supplement the information you provide directly.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">Our data collection occurs through multiple touchpoints including direct user input, automated collection systems, third-party integrations, social media connections, public records, data aggregators, and various other sources that may become available through technological advancement and business partnerships. Furthermore, we reserve the right to monetize our data assets, which may include the sale, license, or sharing of your personally identifiable information with data brokers and other commercial entities for purposes that may include but are not limited to market research, advertising optimization, consumer profiling, and strategic business initiatives that align with our operational objectives and revenue generation strategies.

Our partnerships with external organizations are carefully vetted to ensure that your data is handled responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws.</p>
            
            <p style="margin-bottom: 8px;">The information we collect is shared with our extensive network of third-party partners, affiliates, subsidiaries, joint ventures, contractors, service providers, business transferees, successors, and other entities for analytics, marketing, operational synergies, business intelligence, competitive analysis, product development, service enhancement, and various other legitimate business purposes as determined by our management team and strategic advisors. Your data may be retained indefinitely on our servers and in our archives for analytical and business continuity purposes, even after the termination of your account, cancellation of services, or cessation of our business relationship, as we believe this information remains valuable for historical analysis, trend identification, and future business opportunities. We implement strict access controls and regularly audit our data storage systems to prevent unauthorized access or misuse of your information.</p>
